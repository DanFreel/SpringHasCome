Setup python via command line
   1) Install download embeddable zip file for the version of python desired.
      Download link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

   2) Unzip contents into a directory. 
      Add that directory onto the PATH.

   3) You will have a file that was unzipped called "pythonXX.zip".
      Create a directory with the same name, and unzip the contents of the zip file into it. 
      Make sure that the directory is also postfixed with ".zip"

   4) If you have any modules already loaded, you will have a "Scripts" directory created in your python directory. Add that to the class path as well. 
          This will allow you to run modules without using "python -m 'module name'"

   Note: Depending on the directory where you stored the python directory, its possible you will need to run your command line application using Admin-Mode.


Setup pip (allowing you to install other modules)
   1) Download get-pip.py and copy it into the Python directory.
      Download Link: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/

   2) Using a shell in admin-mode, execute "get-pip.py".


Setup Scrapy module
   1) For several modules, you will need lxml setup. 
      However, pip install lxml won't work because... you are missing lxml. 
      (I know this is stupid). 

   1.1) Download manually the wheel file for lxml and save it in your user directory.
        Download Link: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml

   1.2) run "pip install 'name_of_wheel_file'" and this will install lxml.

   2) pip install Scrapy
